# DSA-leetcode-solutions


This repository contains my **C++ solutions to LeetCode problems**, maintained primarily for **learning and practicing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.

##  Purpose

- Practice **problem-solving** using C++
- Track my learning progress over time
- Revise and improve solutions as my understanding grows

This is a **personal learning repository**, and solutions may be updated, optimized, or rewritten as I learn better approaches.

##  Repository Structure

- Each file corresponds to **one LeetCode problem**
- **Filename format**:
<problem-number>-<problem-name>.cpp

**Example:**
1-Two-Sum.cpp

- The problem number matches the **official LeetCode question number**.


##  Disclaimer
These exist solely to **learn, experiment, and grow** as a programmer.
